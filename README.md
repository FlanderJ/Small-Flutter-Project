# project_native_prototype
The main view of native prototype of an application called "NutriBot", which follows the responsive design principles. It is part of a project where my group designed a UI following human-centric design principles for the implementation of an "Automated garden balcony". 

NOTE! The code can also be run in DartPad, but the logo in the first "button" of the view won't be visible, since all Widgets it uses are not supported in DartPad.
NOTE! I'm a very beginner with Dart and Flutter framework. I was responsible for this prototype on the project.
NOTE! There are no other views in this project since they were not required.

If you want to know more about the background of this subject, here is a short problem definition for the project that was created:

Problem definition 

This project can be seen as a partial solution to a main problem that regards food production. Food production is no longer in the hands of most of the population, only a handful of people know how the food they are eating is produced. This jeopardizes not just our health but also the health of the environment. The real problem related to the subject is that most people won’t have enough time and resources to produce their food, so they have no choice but to rely on food production by other people, in most cases on big corporations. This causes the main problem. 

The aforementioned problems are not the only ones. Another one lies in the living habitats of many. Most people don’t own any land, where they could grow crops, since they are living in apartment houses. Because so many people live in these kinds of circumstances, a solution to this problem would provide a substantial increase in the well-being of a large group of people. This is the issue we are here to solve. 

Project goal 

Our goal is to provide a user-friendly system that takes care of crops and informs the user of what, how and when a certain action must be taken. This system will be within the reach of most people since it will be implemented to the balcony of the/house, this makes it reachable also for those that live in apartment houses. 

Our solution will take food production back into the hands of consumers. We will be providing solutions that can be implemented on any balcony, no matter the shape or size. The functions that our solution provides are plant health monitoring, and giving instructions on what, when and how action must be taken, for example how the user should harvest their carrots.
